## 🛠️ Projects

Here are a few noteworthy projects I've worked on:

1. [Android Malware Detection](https://github.com/mkdhake2000/Android-Malware-Detection):
  - Developed a web application to distinguish between benign and malicious instances of Android applications.
  - Employed open-source reverse engineering tools viz. Androguard and APKtool, to extract features from decompiled APKs. These features encompassed attributes such as Android Permissions, API Calls, and OPcode Sequences.
  - Applied SVM, Random Forest, and ANN to categorize applications using extracted features with up to 94% accuracy.

2. [Stock Data Extraction, Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/mkdhake2000/Stock-Data-Extraction-Analysis-and-Prediction): 
  - Scrapped and Analyzed Indian stock market data for effective investment strategies. Used Feature extraction, Outlier Detection to analyze stock features such as Moving Average, Average Daily Return, and Inter-Stock Correlations.
  - Applied methods like Monte Carlo Simulations and Bollinger Bands to assess risk and get trade recommendations.
  - Employed portfolio diversification through Clustering and trained an LSTM Model to predict Mindtree stock prices.

3. [Computational Linguistics In Indian Languages](https://github.com/mkdhake2000/Information-Retreival-Assignment-2):
  - Tokenized and stemmed linguistic corpus to implement IR systems like Boolean Retrieval, TF-IDF, and BM25.
  - Used pre-trained word vectors like GloVe, CBOW, Skipgram, and FastText, to assess word similarity scores.
  - Implemented N-gram models to get most frequent words, letters, and syllables in the context of Indian languages.
  - Trained an LSA model on an Indian Language Corpus, to get high-quality embeddings for representation of words.
